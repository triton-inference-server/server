Triton Inference Server is an open source inference serving software that
streamlines AI inferencing. Triton enables teams to deploy any AI model from
multiple deep learning and machine learning frameworks, including TensorRT,
TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, OpenVINO, Python, RAPIDS FIL, and more. Triton
Inference Server supports inference across cloud, data center, edge and embedded
devices on NVIDIA GPUs, x86 and ARM CPU, or AWS Inferentia. Triton Inference
Server delivers optimized performance for many query types, including real time,
batched, ensembles and audio/video streaming. Triton inference Server is part of
[NVIDIA AI Enterprise](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/),
a software platform that accelerates the data science pipeline and streamlines
the development and deployment of production AI.

## Serve a Model in 3 Easy Steps

```bash
# Step 1: Create the example model repository
git clone -b r24.02 https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server.git
cd server/docs/examples
./fetch_models.sh

# Step 2: Launch triton from the NGC Triton container
docker run --gpus=1 --rm --net=host -v ${PWD}/model_repository:/models nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:24.02-py3 tritonserver --model-repository=/models

# Step 3: Sending an Inference Request
# In a separate console, launch the image_client example from the NGC Triton SDK container
docker run -it --rm --net=host nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:24.02-py3-sdk
/workspace/install/bin/image_client -m densenet_onnx -c 3 -s INCEPTION /workspace/images/mug.jpg

# Inference should return the following
Image '/workspace/images/mug.jpg':
    15.346230 (504) = COFFEE MUG
    13.224326 (968) = CUP
    10.422965 (505) = COFFEEPOT
```
Please read the [QuickStart](docs/getting_started/quickstart.md) guide for additional information
regarding this example. The quickstart guide also contains an example of how to launch Triton on [CPU-only systems](docs/getting_started/quickstart.md#run-on-cpu-only-system). New to Triton and wondering where to get started? Watch the [Getting Started video](https://youtu.be/NQDtfSi5QF4).

  [AWS](deploy/aws/README.md), and [NVIDIA FleetCommand](deploy/fleetcommand/README.md)
- [Secure Deployment Considerations](docs/customization_guide/deploy.md)

### Using Triton

#### Preparing Models for Triton Inference Server

The first step in using Triton to serve your models is to place one or
more models into a [model repository](docs/user_guide/model_repository.md). Depending on
the type of the model and on what Triton capabilities you want to enable for
the model, you may need to create a [model
configuration](docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md) for the model.

- [Add custom operations to Triton if needed by your model](docs/user_guide/custom_operations.md)
- Enable model pipelining with [Model Ensemble](docs/user_guide/architecture.md#ensemble-models)
  and [Business Logic Scripting (BLS)](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend#business-logic-scripting)
- Optimize your models setting [scheduling and batching](docs/user_guide/architecture.md#models-and-schedulers)
  parameters and [model instances](docs/user_guide/model_configuration.md#instance-groups).
- Use the [Model Analyzer tool](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/model_analyzer)
  to help optimize your model configuration with profiling
- Learn how to [explicitly manage what models are available by loading and
  unloading models](docs/user_guide/model_management.md)

#### Configure and Use Triton Inference Server

- Read the [Quick Start Guide](docs/getting_started/quickstart.md) to run Triton Inference
  Server on both GPU and CPU
- Triton supports multiple execution engines, called
  [backends](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/backend#where-can-i-find-all-the-backends-that-are-available-for-triton), including
  [TensorRT](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorrt_backend),
  [TensorFlow](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorflow_backend),
  [PyTorch](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/pytorch_backend),
  [ONNX](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/onnxruntime_backend),
  [OpenVINO](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/openvino_backend),
  [Python](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend), and more
- Not all the above backends are supported on every platform supported by Triton.
  Look at the
  [Backend-Platform Support Matrix](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/backend/blob/main/docs/backend_platform_support_matrix.md)
  to learn which backends are supported on your target platform.
- Learn how to [optimize performance](docs/user_guide/optimization.md) using the
  [Performance Analyzer](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/blob/main/src/c++/perf_analyzer/README.md)
  and
  [Model Analyzer](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/model_analyzer)
- Learn how to [manage loading and unloading models](docs/user_guide/model_management.md) in
  Triton
- Send requests directly to Triton with the [HTTP/REST JSON-based
  or gRPC protocols](docs/customization_guide/inference_protocols.md#httprest-and-grpc-protocols)

#### Client Support and Examples

A Triton *client* application sends inference and other requests to Triton. The
[Python and C++ client libraries](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client)
provide APIs to simplify this communication.

- Review client examples for [C++](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/blob/main/src/c%2B%2B/examples),
  [Python](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/blob/main/src/python/examples),
  and [Java](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/blob/main/src/java/src/main/java/triton/client/examples)
- Configure [HTTP](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client#http-options)
  and [gRPC](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client#grpc-options)
  client options
- Send input data (e.g. a jpeg image) directly to Triton in the [body of an HTTP
  request without any additional metadata](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/protocol/extension_binary_data.md#raw-binary-request)

### Extend Triton

[Triton Inference Server's architecture](docs/user_guide/architecture.md) is specifically
designed for modularity and flexibility

- [Customize Triton Inference Server container](docs/customization_guide/compose.md) for your use case
- [Create custom backends](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/backend)
  in either [C/C++](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/backend/blob/main/README.md#triton-backend-api)
  or [Python](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend)
- Create [decoupled backends and models](docs/user_guide/decoupled_models.md) that can send
  multiple responses for a request or not send any responses for a request
- Use a [Triton repository agent](docs/customization_guide/repository_agents.md) to add functionality
  that operates when a model is loaded and unloaded, such as authentication,
  decryption, or conversion
- Deploy Triton on [Jetson and JetPack](docs/user_guide/jetson.md)
- [Use Triton on AWS
   Inferentia](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend/tree/main/inferentia)
