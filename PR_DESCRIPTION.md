# Add Apple Silicon Optimizations to NVIDIA Triton Inference Server

## Summary

This PR introduces comprehensive Apple Silicon optimizations for NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, enabling high-performance inference on macOS systems with M1, M2, M3, and future Apple Silicon processors. The implementation leverages Apple's hardware acceleration capabilities including AMX (Apple Matrix coprocessor), ANE (Apple Neural Engine), and Metal GPU with unified memory support.

## Key Features

### 1. AMX (Apple Matrix Coprocessor) Support
- High-performance matrix operations using Apple's Accelerate framework
- Automatic hardware detection and capability querying
- Support for FP32, FP16, BF16 (M3+), and INT8 operations
- Optimized kernels for GEMM, convolution, and common neural network operations

### 2. ANE (Apple Neural Engine) Integration
- CoreML-based neural network acceleration
- Automatic model optimization and quantization
- Specialized transformer optimizations with Flash Attention support
- Dynamic operation routing between ANE/GPU/CPU

### 3. Metal Backend Enhancements
- Zero-copy unified memory support leveraging Apple Silicon's architecture
- Advanced memory pooling with size-classed allocation
- Comprehensive performance monitoring (GPU utilization, memory bandwidth, power)
- Prometheus metrics integration for production monitoring

### 4. Specialized Optimizations
- Winograd F(2x2, 3x3) convolution for efficient 3x3 convolutions
- Profile-guided optimization for dynamic kernel selection
- NEON SIMD optimizations for ARM-based operations

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation between AMX, ANE, and Metal components
- **Transparent Integration**: Operations automatically use optimized paths when available
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation when hardware features unavailable
- **Memory Efficiency**: Unified memory eliminates CPU-GPU copies on Apple Silicon

### Code Quality
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and TRITONSERVER_Error propagation
- **Resource Management**: RAII patterns with proper cleanup in all paths
- **Documentation**: Detailed inline documentation and user guide
- **Thread Safety**: Proper synchronization for concurrent operations

### Build System
- **CMake Integration**: New options TRITON_ENABLE_METAL and TRITON_ENABLE_APPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS
- **Platform Detection**: Automatic detection of macOS and Apple Silicon
- **Conditional Compilation**: Features compile only on supported platforms

## Performance Impact

Expected performance improvements on Apple Silicon:
- **Matrix Operations**: 2-5x speedup using AMX vs CPU baseline
- **Neural Networks**: 3-10x speedup using ANE for compatible models
- **Memory Transfers**: Near-zero overhead with unified memory
- **Power Efficiency**: 40-60% reduction in power consumption for AI workloads

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Comprehensive test coverage for all new components
- Tests for error conditions and edge cases
- Performance regression tests

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end model inference tests
- Multi-backend coordination tests
- Memory pressure and thermal throttling tests

### Benchmarks
- Matrix operation benchmarks (AMX vs CPU vs GPU)
- Neural network inference benchmarks
- Memory bandwidth and latency measurements

## Compatibility

- **macOS Version**: 11.0 or later required
- **Hardware**: M1, M2, M3, and future Apple Silicon
- **Backward Compatible**: No impact on non-Apple platforms
- **API Compatible**: No changes to existing Triton APIs

## Future Work

1. **Extended Winograd**: F(4x4, 3x3) and F(6x6, 3x3) implementations
2. **Multi-ANE**: Utilize multiple Neural Engine cores
3. **Sparse Operations**: Leverage M3+ sparse acceleration
4. **Custom Metal Kernels**: Shader generation for specialized operations

## Checklist

- [x] Code follows Triton coding standards
- [x] All tests pass locally
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Performance benchmarks included
- [x] No hardcoded paths or values
- [x] Proper error handling throughout
- [x] Memory leaks verified with tools
- [x] Thread safety verified
- [x] CMake changes tested on multiple platforms

## Notes for Reviewers

1. The AMX implementation uses Accelerate framework rather than direct AMX instructions (which are undocumented)
2. ANE integration requires CoreML, which is only available on macOS
3. Metal unified memory provides significant performance benefits on Apple Silicon
4. All Apple-specific code is properly guarded with platform checks

Please review with particular attention to:
- Memory management in Metal allocator
- Thread safety in singleton implementations  
- CMake integration and build configuration
- API design for extensibility
