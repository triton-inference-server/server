# Triton Inference Server

Triton Inference Server enables teams to deploy any AI model from multiple deep
learning and machine learning frameworks, including TensorRT, TensorFlow,
PyTorch, ONNX, OpenVINO, Python, RAPIDS FIL, and more. Triton supports inference
across cloud, data center, edge and embedded devices on NVIDIA GPUs, x86 and ARM
CPU, or AWS Inferentia. Triton Inference Server delivers optimized performance
for many query types, including real time, batched, ensembles and audio/video
streaming. Triton inference Server is part of
[NVIDIA AI Enterprise](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/),
a software platform that accelerates the data science pipeline and streamlines
the development and deployment of production AI.

Major features include:

- [Supports multiple deep learning
  frameworks](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/backend#where-can-i-find-all-the-backends-that-are-available-for-triton)
- [Supports multiple machine learning
  frameworks](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/fil_backend)
- [Concurrent model
  execution](user_guide/architecture.md#concurrent-model-execution)
- [Dynamic batching](user_guide/model_configuration.md#dynamic-batcher)
- [Sequence batching](user_guide/model_configuration.md#sequence-batcher) and
  [implicit state management](user_guide/architecture.md#implicit-state-management)
  for stateful models
- Provides [Backend API](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/backend) that
  allows adding custom backends and pre/post processing operations
- Model pipelines using
  [Ensembling](user_guide/architecture.md#ensemble-models) or [Business
  Logic Scripting
  (BLS)](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend#business-logic-scripting)
- [HTTP/REST and GRPC inference
  protocols](customization_guide/inference_protocols.md) based on the community
  developed [KServe
  protocol](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/tree/master/docs/predict-api/v2)
- A [C API](customization_guide/inference_protocols.md#in-process-triton-server-api) and
  [Java API](customization_guide/inference_protocols.md#java-bindings-for-in-process-triton-server-api)
  allow Triton to link directly into your application for edge and other in-process use cases
- [Metrics](user_guide/metrics.md) indicating GPU utilization, server
  throughput, server latency, and more
