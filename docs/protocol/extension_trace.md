# Trace Extension

This document describes Triton's trace extension. The trace extension enables
the client to configure the trace settings during a Triton run. Because this
extension is supported, Triton reports “trace” in the extensions field of
its Server Metadata.

## HTTP/REST

In all JSON schemas shown in this document $number, $string, $boolean,
$object and $array refer to the fundamental JSON types. #optional
indicates an optional JSON field.

Triton exposes the trace endpoint at the following URL. The client may use
HTTP GET request to retrieve the current trace setting. A HTTP POST request
will modify the trace setting, and the endpoint will return the updated trace
setting on success or an error in the case of failure. Optional model name and
model version can be provided to get or to set the trace settings for specific
model or model version. Note that when a model or model version is specified
without providing any trace settings in the request body, it will be a request
to remove the specification. 

```
GET v2[/models/${MODEL_NAME}[/versions/${MODEL_VERSION}]]/trace

POST v2[/models/${MODEL_NAME}[/versions/${MODEL_VERSION}]]/trace
```

### Trace Response JSON Object

A successful trace request is indicated by a 200 HTTP status
code. The response object, identified as $trace_response, is
returned in the HTTP body for every successful trace request.

```
$trace_response =
{
  $trace_setting, ...
}

$trace_setting = $string : $string | [ $string, ...]
```

Each $trace_setting JSON describes a “name”/”value” pair, where the “name” is
the name of the trace setting and the “value” is a $string representation of the
setting value, or an array of $string for some settings. Currently the following
trace settings are defined:

- "trace_file" : the file where the trace output will be saved. If
"log frequency" is set, this will be the prefix of the files to save the
trace output, resulting files in name "${trace_file}.0", "${trace_file}.1"...,
see trace setting "log frequency" below for detail.
- "trace_level" : the trace level. "OFF" to disable tracing,
TIMESTAMPS" to trace timestamps, "TENSORS" to trace tensors.
It may be specified multiple times to trace multiple informations.
- "trace_rate" : the trace sampling rate. The value represents how many requests
will one trace be sampled from. For example, if the trace rate is "1000",
1 trace will be sampled for every 1000 requests.
- "log_frequency" : the frequency that Triton will log the
trace output to the files. If the value is "0", Triton will only log
the trace output to ${trace_file} when shutting down. Otherwise, Triton will log
the trace output to ${trace_file}.${idx} when it collects
the specified number of traces. For example, if the log frequency is "100",
when Triton collects the 100-th trace, it logs the traces to file
"${trace_file}.0", and when it collects the 200-th trace, it logs the 101-th to
the 200-th traces to file "${trace_file}.1". Note that the file index will be
reset to 0 when "trace_file" setting is updated.


### Trace Response JSON Error Object

A failed trace request will be indicated by an HTTP error status
(typically 400). The HTTP body must contain the
$trace_error_response object.

```
$trace_error_response =
{
  "error": $string
}
```

- “error” : The descriptive message for the error.

#### Trace Request JSON Object

A trace configure request is made with a HTTP POST to
the trace endpoint. In the corresponding response the HTTP body contains the
response JSON. A successful request is indicated by a 200 HTTP status code.

The request object, identified as $trace_request must be provided in the HTTP
body.

```
$trace_request =
{
  $trace_setting, ...
}
```

The $trace_setting JSON is defined in
[Trace Response JSON Object](#Trace-Response-JSON-bject), only the specified
settings will be updated. Note that if this is the first request to initalize
a model (version) trace settings, for the trace settings that are not specified
in the request, the value will be copied from the current setting in the
following order: version settings, model settings, global settings.

## GRPC

For the trace extension Triton implements the following API:

```
service GRPCInferenceService
{
  …

  // Update and get the trace setting of the Triton server.
  rpc Trace(TraceRequest)
          returns (TraceResponse) {}
}
```

The Trace API returns the latest trace settings. Errors are indicated
by the google.rpc.Status returned for the request. The OK code
indicates success and other codes indicate failure. The request and
response messages for Trace are:

```
message TraceRequest
{
  // The new setting values to be updated,
  // settings that are not specified will remain unchanged.
  map<string, string> settings = 1;

  // The name of the model to apply the new trace settings.
  // If not given, the new settings will be applied globally.
  string model_name = 1;

  // The version of the model to apply the new trace settings.
  // If not given, the new settings will be applied to all version of the model.
  // 'model_version' is ignored if 'model_name' is not specified.
  string model_version = 2;
}

message TraceResponse
{
  // The latest trace settings.
  map<string, string> settings = 1;
}
```

The trace settings are mentioned in
[Trace Response JSON Object](#Trace-Response-JSON-bject).
Note that if this is the first request to initalize
a model (version) trace settings, for the trace settings that are not specified
in the request, the value will be copied from the current setting in the
following order: version settings, model settings, global settings.
