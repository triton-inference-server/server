# HTTP/REST and GRPC Protocol

This directory contains documents related to the HTTP/REST and GRPC
protocols used by Triton. Triton uses the [KServe community standard
inference
protocols](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/tree/master/docs/predict-api/v2)
plus several extensions that are defined in the following documents:

- [Binary tensor data extension](./extension_binary_data.md)
- [Classification extension](./extension_classification.md)
- [Schedule policy extension](./extension_schedule_policy.md)
- [Sequence extension](./extension_sequence.md)
- [Shared-memory extension](./extension_shared_memory.md)
- [Model configuration extension](./extension_model_configuration.md)
- [Model repository extension](./extension_model_repository.md)
- [Statistics extension](./extension_statistics.md)
- [Trace extension](./extension_trace.md)
- [Logging extension](./extension_logging.md)
- [Parameters extension](./extension_parameters.md)

Note that some extensions introduce new fields onto the inference protocols,
and the other extensions define new protocols that Triton follows, please refer
to the extension documents for detail.

For the GRPC protocol, the [protobuf
specification](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/common/blob/main/protobuf/grpc_service.proto)
is also available. In addition, you can find the GRPC health checking protocol protobuf
specification [here](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/common/blob/main/protobuf/health.proto).

## Restricted Protocols

You can configure the Triton endpoints, which implement the protocols, to
restrict access to some protocols and to control network settings, please refer
to [protocol customization guide](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/customization_guide/inference_protocols.md#httprest-and-grpc-protocols) for detail.

## IPv6

Assuming your host or [docker config](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/ipv6/)
supports IPv6 connections, `tritonserver` can be configured to use IPv6
HTTP endpoints as follows:
```
$ tritonserver ... --http-address ipv6:[::1]&
...
I0215 21:04:11.572305 571 grpc_server.cc:4868] Started GRPCInferenceService at 0.0.0.0:8001
I0215 21:04:11.572528 571 http_server.cc:3477] Started HTTPService at ipv6:[::1]:8000
I0215 21:04:11.614167 571 http_server.cc:184] Started Metrics Service at ipv6:[::1]:8002
```

This can be confirmed via `netstat`, for example:
```
$ netstat -tulpn | grep tritonserver
tcp6      0      0 :::8000      :::*      LISTEN      571/tritonserver
tcp6      0      0 :::8001      :::*      LISTEN      571/tritonserver
tcp6      0      0 :::8002      :::*      LISTEN      571/tritonserver
```

And can be tested via `curl`, for example:
```
$ curl -6 --verbose "http://[::1]:8000/v2/health/ready"
*   Trying ::1:8000...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to ::1 (::1) port 8000 (#0)
> GET /v2/health/ready HTTP/1.1
> Host: [::1]:8000
> User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
> Accept: */*
>
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 0
< Content-Type: text/plain
<
* Connection #0 to host ::1 left intact
```
