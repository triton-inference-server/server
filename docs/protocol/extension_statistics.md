# Statistics Extension

This document describes Triton's statistics extension. The statistics
extension enables the reporting of per-model (per-version) statistics
which provide aggregate information about all activity occurring for a
specific model (version) since Triton started. Because this extension
is supported, Triton reports “statistics” in the extensions field of
its Server Metadata.

## HTTP/REST

In all JSON schemas shown in this document $number, $string, $boolean,
$object and $array refer to the fundamental JSON types. #optional
indicates an optional JSON field.

Triton exposes the statistics endpoint at the following URL. The
specific model name portion of the URL is optional; if not provided
Triton will return the statistics for all versions of all models. If a
specific model is given in the URL the versions portion of the URL is
optional; if not provided Triton will return statistics for all
versions of the specified model.

```
GET v2/models[/${MODEL_NAME}[/versions/${MODEL_VERSION}]]/stats
```

### Statistics Response JSON Object

A successful statistics request is indicated by a 200 HTTP status
code. The response object, identified as $stats_model_response, is
returned in the HTTP body for every successful statistics request.

```
$stats_model_response =
{
  "model_stats" : [ $model_stat, ... ]
}
```

Each $model_stat object gives the statistics for a specific model and
version. The $version field is optional for servers that do not
support versions.

```
$model_stat =
{
  "name" : $string,
  "version" : $string #optional,
  "last_inference" : $number,
  "inference_count" : $number,
  "execution_count" : $number,
  "inference_stats" : $inference_stats,
  "batch_stats" : [ $batch_stat, ... ]
}
```

- "name" : The name of the model.

- "version" : The version of the model.

- "last_inference" : The timestamp of the last inference request made
  for this model, as milliseconds since the epoch.

- "inference_count" : The cumulative count of successful inference
  requests made for this model. Each inference in a batched request is
  counted as an individual inference. For example, if a client sends a
  single inference request with batch size 64, "inference_count" will
  be incremented by 64. Similarly, if a clients sends 64 individual
  requests each with batch size 1, "inference_count" will be
  incremented by 64. The "inference_count" value DOES NOT include cache hits.

- "execution_count" : The cumulative count of the number of successful
  inference executions performed for the model. When dynamic batching
  is enabled, a single model execution can perform inferencing for
  more than one inference request. For example, if a clients sends 64
  individual requests each with batch size 1 and the dynamic batcher
  batches them into a single large batch for model execution then
  "execution_count" will be incremented by 1. If, on the other hand,
  the dynamic batcher is not enabled for that each of the 64
  individual requests is executed independently, then
  "execution_count" will be incremented by 64. The "execution_count" value
  DOES NOT include cache hits.

- "inference_stats" : The aggregate statistics for the
  model/version. So, for example, "inference_stats":"success"
  indicates the number of successful inference requests for the model.

- "batch_stats" : The aggregate statistics for each different batch
  size that is executed in the model. The batch statistics indicate
  how many actual model executions were performed and show differences
  due to different batch size (for example, larger batches typically
  take longer to compute).

```
$inference_stats =
{
  "success" : $duration_stat,
  "fail" : $duration_stat,
  "queue" : $duration_stat,
  "compute_input" : $duration_stat,
  "compute_infer" : $duration_stat,
  "compute_output" : $duration_stat,
  "cache_hit": $duration_stat,
  "cache_miss": $duration_stat
}
```

- “success” : The count and cumulative duration for all successful
  inference requests. The "success" count and cumulative duration includes
  cache hits.

- “fail” : The count and cumulative duration for all failed inference
  requests.

- “queue” : The count and cumulative duration that inference requests
  wait in scheduling or other queues. The "queue" count and cumulative
  duration includes cache hits.

- “compute_input” : The count and cumulative duration to prepare input
  tensor data as required by the model framework / backend. For
  example, this duration should include the time to copy input tensor
  data to the GPU. The "compute_input" count and cumulative duration DO NOT
  include cache hits.

- “compute_infer” : The count and cumulative duration to execute the
  model. The "compute_infer" count and cumulative duration DO NOT include
  cache hits.

- “compute_output” : The count and cumulative duration to extract
  output tensor data produced by the model framework / backend. For
  example, this duration should include the time to copy output tensor
  data from the GPU. The "compute_output" count and cumulative duration DO NOT
  include cache hits.

- "cache_hit" : The count of response cache hits and cumulative duration to
  lookup and extract output tensor data from the Response Cache on a cache hit.
  For example, this duration should include the time to copy output tensor data
  from the Response Cache to the response object.

- "cache_miss" : The count of response cache misses and cumulative duration to
  lookup and insert output tensor data to the Response Cache on a cache miss.
  For example, this duration should include the time to copy output tensor data
  from the response object to the Response Cache.


```
$batch_stats =
{
  "batch_size" : $number,
  "compute_input" : $duration_stat,
  "compute_infer" : $duration_stat,
  "compute_output" : $duration_stat
}
```

- "batch_size" : The size of the batch.

- "count" : The number of times the batch size was executed on the
  model. A single model execution performs inferencing for the entire
  request batch and can perform inferencing for multiple requests if
  dynamic batching is enabled.

- “compute_input” : The count and cumulative duration to prepare input
  tensor data as required by the model framework / backend with the
  given batch size. For example, this duration should include the time
  to copy input tensor data to the GPU.

- “compute_infer” : The count and cumulative duration to execute the
  model with the given batch size.

- “compute_output” : The count and cumulative duration to extract
  output tensor data produced by the model framework / backend with
  the given batch size. For example, this duration should include the
  time to copy output tensor data from the GPU.

The $duration_stat object reports a count and a total time. This
format can be sampled to determine not only long-running averages but
also incremental averages between sample points.

```
$duration_stat =
{
  "count" : $number,
  "ns" : $number
}
```

- "count" : The number of times the statistic was collected.

- “ns” : The total duration for the statistic in nanoseconds.

### Statistics Response JSON Error Object

A failed statistics request will be indicated by an HTTP error status
(typically 400). The HTTP body must contain the
$repository_statistics_error_response object.

```
$repository_statistics_error_response =
{
  "error": $string
}
```

- “error” : The descriptive message for the error.

## GRPC

For the statistics extension Triton implements the following API:

```
service GRPCInferenceService
{
  …

  // Get the cumulative statistics for a model and version.
  rpc ModelStatistics(ModelStatisticsRequest)
          returns (ModelStatisticsResponse) {}
}
```

The ModelStatistics API returns model statistics. Errors are indicated
by the google.rpc.Status returned for the request. The OK code
indicates success and other codes indicate failure. The request and
response messages for ModelStatistics are:

```
message ModelStatisticsRequest
{
  // The name of the model. If not given returns statistics for all
  // models.
  string name = 1;

  // The version of the model. If not given returns statistics for
  // all model versions.
  string version = 2;
}

message ModelStatisticsResponse
{
  // Statistics for each requested model.
  repeated ModelStatistics model_stats = 1;
}
```

The statistics messages are:

```
// Statistic recording a cumulative duration metric.
message StatisticDuration
{
  // Cumulative number of times this metric occurred.
  uint64 count = 1;

  // Total collected duration of this metric in nanoseconds.
  uint64 ns = 2;
}

// Statistics for a specific model and version.

  // incremented by 64. Similarly, if a clients sends 64 individual
  // requests each with batch size 1, "inference_count" will be
