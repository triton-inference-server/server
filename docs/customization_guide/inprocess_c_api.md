# C API Description

Triton server functionality is encapsulated in a shared library which
is built from source contained in the [core
repository](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/core). You can
include the full capabilities of Triton by linking the shared library
into your application and by using the C API defined in
[tritonserver.h](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/core/blob/main/include/triton/core/tritonserver.h).

When you link the Triton shared library into your application you are
*not* spawning a separate Triton process, instead, you are including
the Triton core logic directly in your application. The Triton
HTTP/REST or GRPC protocols are not used to communicate with this
Triton core logic, instead all communication between your application
and the Triton core logic must take place via the [Server
API](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/core/blob/main/include/triton/core/tritonserver.h).

The top-level abstraction used by Server API is `TRITONSERVER_Server`,
which represents the Triton core logic that is capable of implementing
all of the features and capabilities of Triton. A
`TRITONSERVER_Server` object is created by calling
`TRITONSERVER_ServerNew` with a set of options that indicate how the
object should be initialized.  Use of `TRITONSERVER_ServerNew` is
demonstrated in [simple.cc](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/src/simple.cc). Once you have created a
`TRITONSERVER_Server` object, you can begin using the rest of the
Server API as described below.

## Error Handling

Most Server API functions return an error object indicating success or
failure. Success is indicated by return `nullptr` (`NULL`). Failure is
indicated by returning a `TRITONSERVER_Error` object. The error code
and message can be retrieved from a `TRITONSERVER_Error` object with
`TRITONSERVER_ErrorCode` and `TRITONSERVER_ErrorMessage`.

The lifecycle and ownership of all Server API objects is documented in
[tritonserver.h](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/core/blob/main/include/triton/core/tritonserver.h). For
`TRITONSERVER_Error`, ownership of the object passes to the caller of
the Server API function. As a result, your application is responsible
for managing the lifecycle of the returned `TRITONSERVER_Error`
object. You must delete the error object using
`TRITONSERVER_ErrorDelete` when you are done using it. Macros such as
`FAIL_IF_ERR` shown in [common.h](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/src/common.h) are useful for
managing error object lifetimes.

## Versioning and Backwards Compatibility

A typical pattern, demonstrated in [simple.cc](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/src/simple.cc) and
shown below, shows how you can compare the Server API version provided
by the shared library against the Server API version that you compiled
your application against. The Server API is backwards compatible, so
as long as the major version provided by the shared library matches
the major version that you compiled against, and the minor version
provided by the shared library is greater-than-or-equal to the minor
version that you compiled against, then your application can use the
Server API.

```
#include "tritonserver.h"
// Error checking removed for clarity...
uint32_t api_version_major, api_version_minor;
TRITONSERVER_ApiVersion(&api_version_major, &api_version_minor);
if ((TRITONSERVER_API_VERSION_MAJOR != api_version_major) ||
    (TRITONSERVER_API_VERSION_MINOR > api_version_minor)) {
  // Error, the shared library implementing the Server API is older than
  // the version of the Server API that you compiled against.
}
```

### Non-Inference APIs

The Server API contains functions for checking health and readiness,
getting model information, getting model statistics and metrics,
loading and unloading models, etc. The use of these functions is
straightforward and some of these functions are demonstrated in
[simple.cc](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/src/simple.cc) and all are documented in
[tritonserver.h](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/core/blob/main/include/triton/core/tritonserver.h).

### Inference APIs

Performing an inference request requires the use of many Server API
functions and objects, as demonstrated in
[simple.cc](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/src/simple.cc). The general usage requires the
following steps.

* Create a `TRITONSERVER_ResponseAllocator` using
  `TRITONSERVER_ResponseAllocatorNew`.  You can use the same response
  allocator for all of your inference requests, or you can create
  multiple response allocators.  When Triton produces an output
  tensor, it needs a memory buffer into which it can store the
  contents of that tensor. Triton defers the allocation of these
  output buffers by invoking callback functions in your
  application. You communicate these callback functions to Triton with
  the `TRITONSERVER_ResponseAllocator` object. You must implement two
  callback functions, one for buffer allocation and one for buffer
  free. The signatures for these functions are
  `TRITONSERVER_ResponseAllocatorAllocFn_t` and
  `TRITONSERVER_ResponseAllocatorReleaseFn_t` as defined in
  [tritonserver.h](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/core/blob/main/include/triton/core/tritonserver.h). In
  [simple.cc](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/src/simple.cc), these callback functions are
  implemented as `ResponseAlloc` and `ResponseRelease`.

* Create an inference request as a `TRITONSERVER_InferenceRequest`
  object. The inference request is where you specify what model you
  want to use, the input tensors and their values, the output tensors
  that you want returned, and other request parameters. You create an
  inference request using `TRITONSERVER_InferenceRequestNew`. You
  create each input tensor in the request using
  `TRITONSERVER_InferenceRequestAddInput` and set the data for the
  input tensor using `TRITONSERVER_InferenceRequestAppendInputData`
  (or one of the `TRITONSERVER_InferenceRequestAppendInputData*`
  variants defined in
  [tritonserver.h](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/core/blob/main/include/triton/core/tritonserver.h)). By
  default, Triton will return all output tensors, but you can limit
  Triton to only return some outputs by using
  `TRITONSERVER_InferenceRequestAddRequestedOutput`.

  To correctly manage the lifecycle of the inference request, you must
  use `TRITONSERVER_InferenceRequestSetReleaseCallback` to set a
  callback into a function in your application. This callback will be
  invoke by Triton to return ownership of the
  `TRITONSERVER_InferenceRequest` object. Typically, in this callback
  you will just delete the `TRITONSERVER_InferenceRequest` object by
  using `TRITONSERVER_InferenceRequestDelete`. But you may also
  implement a different lifecycle management; for example, if you are
  reusing inference request objects you would want to make the object
  available for reuse.

  You can optionally use `TRITONSERVER_InferenceRequestSetId` to set a
  user-defined ID on the request. This ID is not used by Triton but
  will be returned in the response.

  You can reuse an existing `TRITONSERVER_InferenceRequest` object for
  a new inference request. A couple of examples of how this is done
  and why it is useful are shown in [simple.cc](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/src/simple.cc).

* Ask Triton to execute the inference request using
  `TRITONSERVER_ServerInferAsync`. `TRITONSERVER_ServerInferAsync` is
  a asynchronous call that returns immediately. The inference response
  is returned via a callback into your application. You register this
  callback using `TRITONSERVER_InferenceRequestSetResponseCallback`
  before you invoke `TRITONSERVER_ServerInferAsync`. In
  [simple.cc](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/src/simple.cc) this callback is
  `InferResponseComplete`.

  When you invoke `TRITONSERVER_ServerInferAsync` and it returns
  without error, you are passing ownership of the
  `TRITONSERVER_InferenceRequest` object to Triton, and so you must
  not access that object in any way until Triton returns ownership to
  you via the callback you registered with
  `TRITONSERVER_InferenceRequestSetReleaseCallback`.

* Process the inference response. The inference response is returned
  to the callback function you registered with
  `TRITONSERVER_InferenceRequestSetResponseCallback`. Your callback
  receives the response as a `TRITONSERVER_InferenceResponse`
  object. Your callback takes ownership of the
  `TRITONSERVER_InferenceResponse` object and so must free it with
  `TRITONSERVER_InferenceResponseDelete` when it is no longer needed.

  The first step in processing a response is to use
  `TRITONSERVER_InferenceResponseError` to check if the response is
  returning an error or if it is returning valid results. If the
  response is valid you can use
  `TRITONSERVER_InferenceResponseOutputCount` to iterate over the
  output tensors, and `TRITONSERVER_InferenceResponseOutput` to get
  information about each output tensor.

  Note that the [simple.cc](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/src/simple.cc) example uses a
  std::promise to simply wait for the response, but synchronizing
  response handling in this way is not required. You can have multiple
  inference requests in flight at the same time and can issue
  inference requests from the same thread or from multiple different
  threads.
allows Triton to be linked directly to a C/C++ application. The API
is documented in
[tritonserver.h](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/core/blob/main/include/triton/core/tritonserver.h).

A simple example using the C API can be found in
[simple.cc](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/src/simple.cc).  A more complicated example can be
found in the source that implements the HTTP/REST and GRPC endpoints
for Triton. These endpoints use the C API to communicate with the core
of Triton. The primary source files for the endpoints are
[grpc_server.cc](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/src/grpc/grpc_server.cc) and
[http_server.cc](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/src/http_server.cc).
