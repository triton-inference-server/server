# Customize Triton Container

Two Docker images are available from [NVIDIA GPU Cloud
(NGC)](https://ngc.nvidia.com) that make it possible to easily
construct customized versions of Triton. By customizing Triton you can
significantly reduce the size of the Triton image by removing
functionality that you don't require.

Currently the customization is limited as described below but future
releases will increase the amount of customization that is available.
It is also possible to [build Triton](build.md#building-triton)
from source to get more exact customization.

## Use the compose.py script

The `compose.py` script can be found in the [server repository](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server).
Simply clone the repository and run `compose.py` to create a custom container.
Note: Created container version will depend on the branch that was cloned.
For example branch [r23.10](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/tree/r23.10)
should be used to create a image based on the NGC 23.10 Triton release.

`compose.py` provides `--backend`, `--repoagent` options that allow you to
specify which backends and repository agents to include in the custom image.
For example, the following creates a new docker image that
contains only the TensorFlow 1 and TensorFlow 2 backends and the checksum
repository agent.

Example:
```
python3 compose.py --backend tensorflow1 --backend tensorflow2 --repoagent checksum
```
will provide a container `tritonserver` locally. You can access the container with
```
$ docker run -it tritonserver:latest
```

Note: If `compose.py` is run on release versions `r21.08` and earlier,
the resulting container will have DCGM version 2.2.3 installed.
This may result in different GPU statistic reporting behavior.

### Compose a specific version of Triton

`compose.py` requires two containers: a `min` container which is the
base the compose container is built from and a `full` container from which the
script will extract components. The version of the `min` and `full` container
is determined by the branch of Triton `compose.py` is on.
For example, running
```
python3 compose.py --backend tensorflow1 --repoagent checksum
```
on branch [r23.10](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/tree/r23.10) pulls:
- `min` container `nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:23.10-py3-min`
- `full` container `nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:23.10-py3`

Alternatively, users can specify the version of Triton container to pull from any branch by either:
1. Adding flag `--container-version <container version>` to branch
```
python3 compose.py --backend tensorflow1 --repoagent checksum --container-version 23.10
```
2. Specifying `--image min,<min container image name> --image full,<full container image name>`.
   The user is responsible for specifying compatible `min` and `full` containers.
```
python3 compose.py --backend tensorflow1 --repoagent checksum --image min,nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:23.10-py3-min --image full,nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:23.10-py3
```
Method 1 and 2 will result in the same composed container. Furthermore, `--image` flag overrides the `--container-version` flag when both are specified.

### CPU-only container composition

CPU-only containers are not yet available for customization. Please see [build documentation](build.md) for instructions to build a full CPU-only container. When including TensorFlow or PyTorch backends in the composed container, an additional `gpu-min` container is needed
since this container provided the CUDA stubs and runtime dependencies which are not provided in the CPU only min container.

## Build it yourself

If you would like to do what `compose.py` is doing under the hood yourself, you can run `compose.py` with the `--dry-run` option and then modify the `Dockerfile.compose` file to satisfy your needs.


### Triton with Unsupported and Custom Backends

You can [create and build your own Triton
backend](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/backend).  The
result of that build should be a directory containing your backend
shared library and any additional files required by the
backend. Assuming your backend is called "mybackend" and that the
directory is "./mybackend", adding the following to the Dockerfile `compose.py`
created will create a Triton image that contains all the supported Triton backends plus your
custom backend.

```
COPY ./mybackend /opt/tritonserver/backends/mybackend
```

You also need to install any additional dependencies required by your
backend as part of the Dockerfile. Then use Docker to create the
image.

```
$ docker build -t tritonserver_custom -f Dockerfile.compose .
```
