# Inference Protocols and APIs

Clients can communicate with Triton using either an HTTP/REST or GRPC
protocol, or by a C API.

## HTTP/REST and GRPC Protocols

Triton exposes both HTTP/REST and GRPC endpoints based on [standard
inference
protocols](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/tree/master/docs/predict-api/v2)
that have been proposed by the [KFServing
project](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving). To fully enable all
capabilities Triton also implements a number [HTTP/REST and GRPC
extensions](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/tree/main/docs/protocol).
to the KFServing inference protocol.

The HTTP/REST and GRPC protcols provide endpoints to check server and
model health, metadata and statistics. Additional endpoints allow
model loading and unloading, and inferencing. See the KFServing and
extension documentation for details.

### HTTP Options
Triton provides the following configuration options for server-client network transactions over HTTP protocol.

#### Compression

Triton allows the on-wire compression of request/response on HTTP through its clients. See [HTTP Compression](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/tree/main#compression) for more details.

### GRPC Options
Triton exposes various GRPC parameters for configuring the server-client network transactions. For usage of these options, refer to the output from `tritonserver --help`.

#### SSL/TLS

These options can be used to configure a secured channel for communication. The server-side options include:

* `--grpc-use-ssl`
* `--grpc-use-ssl-mutual`
* `--grpc-server-cert`
* `--grpc-server-key`
* `--grpc-root-cert`

For client-side documentation, see [Client-Side GRPC SSL/TLS](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/tree/main#ssltls)

For more details on overview of authentication in gRPC, refer [here](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/auth/).

#### Compression

Triton allows the on-wire compression of request/response messages by exposing following option on server-side:

* `--grpc-infer-response-compression-level`

For client-side documentation, see [Client-Side GRPC Compression](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/tree/main#compression-1)

Compression can be used to reduce the amount of bandwidth used in server-client communication. For more details, see [gRPC Compression](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_compression.html). 

#### GRPC KeepAlive

Triton exposes GRPC KeepAlive parameters with the default values for both
client and server described [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/keepalive.md).

These options can be used to configure the KeepAlive settings:

* `--grpc-keepalive-time`
* `--grpc-keepalive-timeout`
* `--grpc-keepalive-permit-without-calls`
* `--grpc-http2-max-pings-without-data`
* `--grpc-http2-min-recv-ping-interval-without-data`
* `--grpc-http2-max-ping-strikes`

For client-side documentation, see [Client-Side GRPC KeepAlive](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client/blob/main/README.md#grpc-keepalive).

## C API

The Triton Inference Server provides a backwards-compatible C API that
allows Triton to be linked directly into a C/C++ application. The API
is documented in
[tritonserver.h](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/core/blob/main/include/triton/core/tritonserver.h).

A simple example using the C API can be found in
[simple.cc](../src/servers/simple.cc).  A more complicated example can
be found in the source that implements the HTTP/REST and GRPC
endpoints for Triton. These endpoints use the C API to communicate
with the core of Triton. The primary source files for the endpoints
are [grpc_server.cc](../src/servers/grpc_server.cc) and
[http_server.cc](../src/servers/http_server.cc).
