# Using Triton Inference Server as a shared library for execution on Jetson

This project demonstrates how to run C API applications using Triton Inference Server as a shared library.
We also show how to build and execute such applications on Jetson.

### Prerequisites

* JetPack >= 4.6
* OpenCV >= 4.1.1
* TensorRT >= 8.0.1.6

_NVIDIA internal:_ the versions will be updated accordingly.

### Installation

Follow the installation instructions from the GitHub release page ([https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/releases/](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/releases/)).

In our example, we placed the contents of downloaded release directory under `/opt/tritonserver`.

## Part 1. Concurrent inference and dynamic batching

The purpose of the sample located under [concurrency_and_dynamic_batching](concurrency_and_dynamic_batching)
is to demonstrate the important features of Triton Inference Server such as concurrent model execution and
dynamic batching. In order to do that, we implemented a people detection application using C API and Triton
Inference Server as a shared library.

## Part 2. Analyzing model performance with perf_analyzer

To analyze model performance on Jetson, `perf_analyzer` tool is used. The `perf_analyzer` is included with the
client examples which are available from [several sources](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client#getting-the-client-libraries-and-examples).

From the root directory of this repository, execute to evaluate model performance:

```shell
./perf_analyzer -m peoplenet -b 2 --service-kind=triton_c_api --model-repo=$(pwd)/concurrency_and_dynamic_batching/trtis_model_repo_sample_1 --triton-server-directory=/opt/tritonserver --concurrency-range 1:6 -f perf_c_api.csv
```

The values measured by the `per_analyzer` can be conveniently exported in CSV format. In the example above we saved the results as a `.csv` file. To visualize these results, follow the steps:

* Open [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S8h0bWBBElHUoLd2SOvQPzZzRiQ55xjyqodm_9ireiw)
* Make a copy from the File menu 'Make a copy...'
* Open the copy
* Select the A1 cell on the 'Raw Data' tab
* From the File menu select 'Import...'
* Select 'Upload' and upload the file
* Select 'Replace data at selected cell' and then select the 'Import data' button

You will get visualizations for _latency vs throughput_ and for _componets of latency_.

Refer to [the documentation](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/perf_analyzer.md) to learn more about the tool.
