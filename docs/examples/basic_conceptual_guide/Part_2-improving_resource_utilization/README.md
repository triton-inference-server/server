# Dynamic Batching & Concurrent Model Execution

Part-1 of this series introduced the mechanisms to set up a Triton Inference Server. This iteration discusses the concept of dynamic batching and concurrent model execution. These are important features that can be used to reduce latency as well as increase throughput via higher resource utilization. 

## What is Dynamic Batching?

Dynamic batching, in reference to the Triton Inference Server, refers to the functionality which allows the combining of one or more inference requests into a single batch (which has to be created dynamically) to maximize throughput. 

Dynamic batching can be enabled and configured on per model basis by specifying selections in the model's `config.pbtxt`. Dynamic Batching can be enabled with its default settings by adding the following to the `config.pbtxt` file:
```
dynamic_batching { }
```
While Triton batches these incoming requests without any delay, users can choose to allocate a limited delay for the scheduler to collect more inference requests to be used by the dynamic batcher.

```
dynamic_batching {
    max_queue_delay_microseconds: 100
}
```
Let's discuss a sample scenario(refer the diagram below). Say there are 5 inference requests, `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E`, with batch sizes of `4`, `2`, `2`, `6`, and `2` respectively. Each batch requires time `X ms` to be processed by the model. The maximum batch size supported by the model is `8`. `A` and `C` arrive at time `T = 0`, `B` arrives at time `T = X/3`, and `D` and `E` arrive at time `T = 2*X/3`.

![Dynamic Batching Sample](./img/dynamic_batching.PNG)

In the case where no dynamic batching is used, all requests are processed sequentially, which means that it takes `5X ms` to process all the requests. This process is quite wasteful as each batch processing could have processed more batches than it did in sequential execution.

Using Dynamic batching in this case leads to more efficient packing of requests into the GPU memory resulting in a considerably faster `3X ms`. It also reduces the latency of responses as more queries can be processed in fewer cycles. If the use of `delay` is considered, `A`, `B`, `C` and `D`, `E` can be batched together to get even better utilization of resources. 

**Note:** The above is an extreme version of an ideal case scenario. In practice, not all elements of execution can be perfectly parallelized, resulting in longer execution time for larger batches.

As observed from the above, the use of Dynamic Batching can lead to improvements in both latency and throughput while serving models. This batching feature is mainly focused on providing a solution for stateless models(models which do not maintain a state between execution, like object detection models). Triton's [sequence batcher](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/model_configuration.md#sequence-batcher) can be used to manage multiple inference requests for stateful models. For more information and configurations regarding dynamic batching, refer to the Triton Inference Server [documentation](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/model_configuration.md#scheduling-and-batching).

## Concurrent model execution

The Triton Inference Server can spin up multiple instances of the same model, which can process queries in parallel. Triton can spawn instances on the same device (GPU), or a different device on the same node as per the user's specifications. This customizability is especially useful when considering ensembles that have models with different throughputs. Multiple copies of heavier models can be spawned on a separate GPU to allow for more parallel processing. This is enabled via the use of `instance groups` option in a model's configuration.

```
instance_group [
  {
    count: 2
    kind: KIND_GPU
    gpus: [ 0, 1 ]
  }
] 
```

Let's take the previous example and discuss the effect of adding multiple models for parallel execution. In this example, instead of having a single model process five queries, two models are spawned. ![Multiple Model Instances](./img/multi_instance.PNG)

For a "no dynamic batching" case, as there are model models to execute, the queries are distributed equally. Users can also add [priorities](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/model_configuration.md#priority) to prioritize or de-prioritize any specific instance group.

When considering the case of multiple instances with dynamic batches enabled, the following happens. Owing to the availability of another instance, query `B` which arrives with some delay can be executed using the second instance. With some delay allocated, instance 1 gets filled and launched by time `T = X/2` and since queries `D` and `E` stack up to fill up to the maximum batch size, the second model can start inference without any delay. 

The key takeaway from the above examples is that the Triton Inference Server provides flexibility with respect to policies related to creating more efficient batching, thus enabling better resource utilization, resulting in reduced latency and increased throughput.

## Demonstration

This section showcases the use of dynamic batching and concurrent model execution using the example for Part 1 of this series.

### Getting access to the model

Let's use the `text recognition` used in part 1. We do need to make some minor changes in the model, namely making the 0th axes of the model have dynamic shape to enable batching. Step 1, download the Text Recognition model weights. Use the NGC PyTorch container as the environment for the following.
```
docker run -it --gpus all -v ${PWD}:/scratch nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:<yy.mm>-py3
cd /scratch
wget https://www.dropbox.com/sh/j3xmli4di1zuv3s/AABzCC1KGbIRe2wRwa3diWKwa/None-ResNet-None-CTC.pth
```
Export the models as `.onnx` using the file in the `utils` folder. This file is adapted from [Baek et. al. 2019](https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark).
```
import torch
from utils.model import STRModel

# Create PyTorch Model Object
model = STRModel(input_channels=1, output_channels=512, num_classes=37)

# Load model weights from external file
state = torch.load("None-ResNet-None-CTC.pth")
state = {key.replace("module.", ""): value for key, value in state.items()}
model.load_state_dict(state)

# Create ONNX file by tracing model
trace_input = torch.randn(1, 1, 32, 100)
torch.onnx.export(model, trace_input, "str.onnx", verbose=True, dynamic_axes={'input.1':[0],'308':[0]})
```

### Launching the server

As discussed in `Part 1`, a model repository is a filesystem based repository of models and configuration schema used by the Triton Inference Server (refer to `Part 1` for a more detailed explanation for model repositories). For this example, the model repository structure would need to be set up in the following manner:
```
model_repository
|   
|-- text_recognition
    |
    |-- config.pbtxt
    |-- 1
        |
        |-- model.onnx
```
This repository is a subset from the previous example. The key difference in this set up is the use of `instance_group`(s) and `dynamic_batching` in the model configuration. The additions are as follows:

```
instance_group [
    {
      count: 2
      kind: KIND_GPU
    }
]
dynamic_batching { }
```
With `instance_group` users can primarily tweak two things. First, the number of instances of that model deployed on each GPU. The above example will deploy `2` instances of the model `per GPU`. Secondly, the target GPUs for this group can be specified with `gpus: [ <device number>, ... <device number> ]`.

Adding `dynamic_batching {}` will enable the use of dynamic batches. Users can also add `preferred_batch_size` and `max_queue_delay_microseconds` in the body of dynamic batching to manage more efficient batching per their use case. Explore the [model configuration](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/model_configuration.md#model-configuration) documentation for more information.

With the model repository set up, the Triton Inference Server can be launched.
```
docker run --gpus=all -it --shm-size=256m --rm -p8000:8000 -p8001:8001 -p8002:8002 -v ${PWD}:/workspace/ -v ${PWD}/model_repository:/models nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:yy.mm-py3 bash

tritonserver --model-repository=/models
```

### Measuring Performance

Having made some improvements to the model's serving capabilities by enabling `dynamic batching` and the use of `multiple model instances`, the next step is to measure the impact of these features. To that end, the Triton Inference Server comes packaged with the [Performance Analyzer](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/perf_analyzer.md) which is a tool specifically designed to measure performance for Triton Inference Servers. For ease of use, it is recommended that users run this inside the same container used to run client code in Part 1 of this series.
```
docker run -it --net=host -v ${PWD}:/workspace/ nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:yy.mm-py3-sdk bash
```
On a third terminal, it is advisable to monitor the GPU Utilization to see if the deployment is saturating GPU resources.
```
watch -n0.1 nvidia-smi
```

To measure the performance gain, let's run performance analyzer on the following configurations:

* **No Dynamic Batching, single model instance**: This configuration will be the baseline measurement. To set up the Triton Server in this configuration, do not add `instance_group` or `dynamic_batching` in `config.pbtxt` and make sure to include `--gpus=1` in the `docker run` command to set up the server.

```
# perf_analyzer -m <model name> -b <batch size> --shape <input layer>:<input shape> --concurrency-range <lower number of request>:<higher number of request>:<step>

# Query
perf_analyzer -m text_recognition -b 2 --shape input.1:1,32,100 --concurrency-range 2:16:2 --percentile=95

```

```
As each of the requests had a batch size (of 2), while the maximum batch size of the model was 8, dynamically batching these requests resulted in considerably improved throughput. Another consequence is a reduction in the latency. This reduction can be primarily attributed to reduced wait time in queue wait time. As the requests are batched together, multiple requests can be processed in parallel.

* **Dynamic Batching with multiple model instances**: To set up the Triton Server in this configuration, add `instance_group` in `config.pbtxt` and make sure to include `--gpus=1` and make sure to include `--gpus=1` in the `docker run` command to set up the server. Include `dynamic_batching` per instructions of the previous section in the model configuration. A point to note is that peak GPU utilization on the GPU shot up to 74% (A100 in this case) while just using a single model instance with dynamic batching. Adding one more instance will definitely improve performance but linear perf scaling will not be achieved in this case.

```

This is a perfect example of "simply enabling all the features" isn't a one-size fits all solution. A point to note is that this experiment was conducted by capping the maximum batch size of the model to `8`, while having a single GPU set up. Each production environment is different. Models, hardware, business level SLAs, costs, are all variables which need to be taken into account while selecting appropriate deployment configurations. Running through a grid search for each and every deployment isn't a feasible strategy. To solve this challenge, Triton users can make use of the Model Analyzer covered in Part 3 of this tutorial! Checkout [this section of the documentation](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/user_guide/optimization.md#optimization) for another example of dynamic batching and multiple model instance.

# What's next?

In this tutorial, we covered the two key concepts, `dynamic batching` and `concurrent model execution`, which can be used to improve resource utilization. This is Part 2 of a 5 part tutorial series which covers the challenges faced in deploying Deep Learning models to production. As you may have figured, there are many possible combinations to use the features discussed in this tutorial, especially with nodes having multiple GPUs. Part 3 covers `Model Analyzer`, a tool which helps to find the best possible deployment configuration.
