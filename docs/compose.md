# Customize Triton Container

Two Docker images are available from [NVIDIA GPU Cloud
(NGC)](https://ngc.nvidia.com) that make it possible to easily
construct customized versions of Triton. By customizing Triton you can
significantly reduce the size of the Triton image by removing
functionality that you don't require.

Currently the customization is limited as described below but future
releases will increase the amount of customization that is available.
It is also possible to [build Triton](build.md#building-triton)
from source to get more exact customization.

## Use the compose.py script

The `compose.py` script can be found in the [server repository](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server).
Simply clone the repository and run `compose.py` to create a custom container. 
Note: Created container version will depend on the branch that was cloned. 
For example branch [r21.09](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/tree/r21.09) 
should be used to create a image based on the NGC 21.09 Triton release. 

`compose.py` provides `--backend`, `--repoagent` options that allow you to 
specify which backends and repository agents to include in the custom image. 
The `--enable-gpu` flag indicates that you want to create an image that supports
NVIDIA GPUs. For example, the following creates a new docker image that 
contains only the TensorFlow 1 and TensorFlow 2 backends and the checksum 
repository agent.

Example:
```
python3 compose.py --backend tensorflow1 --backend tensorflow2 --repoagent checksum --enable-gpu
```
will provide a container `tritonserver` locally. You can access the container with
```
$ docker run -it tritonserver:latest
```

Note: If `compose.py` is run on release versions `r21.09` and earlier, 
the resulting container will have DCGM version 2.2.3 installed. 
This may result in different GPU statistic reporting behavior.

### Compose a specific version of Triton

`compose.py` requires two containers: a `min` container which is the 
base the compose container is built from and a `full` container from which the 
script will extract components. The version of the `min` and `full` container 
is determined by the branch of Triton `compose.py` is on. 
For example, running
```
python3 compose.py --backend tensorflow1 --repoagent checksum --enable-gpu
```
on branch [r21.09](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/tree/r21.09) pulls:
- `min` container `nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:21.09-py3-min` 
- `full` container `nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:21.09-py3`

Alternatively, users can specify the version of Triton container to pull from any branch by either:
1. Adding flag `--container-version <container version>` to branch
```
python3 compose.py --backend tensorflow1 --repoagent checksum --container-version 21.09 --enable-gpu
```
2. Specifying `--image min,<min container image name> --image full,<full container image name>`. 
   The user is responsible for specifying compatible `min` and `full` containers. 
```
python3 compose.py --backend tensorflow1 --repoagent checksum --image min,nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:21.09-py3-min --image full,nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:21.09-py3 --enable-gpu
```
Method 1 and 2 will result in the same composed container. Furthermore, `--image` flag overrides the `--container-version` flag when both are specified.

### CPU only container composition

To compose a container that is built for only cpu usage, simply remove the 
`--enable-gpu` flag when running `compose.py`. 

This will build a container using `ubuntu:20.04` docker as the `min` container 
and `nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:<upstream-container-version>-cpu-only-py3` as the `full` container.
Note: 
1. When composing a CPU only container, both `min` and `full` containers should be built for CPU only and not have CUDA installed.
2. CPU only containers are only available for Triton versions > `21.09` 
3. CPU only "full" containers are build with less backends then the GPU enabled containers. Currently supported backends are `onnxruntime`, `openvino` and `python`.

## Build it yourself

If you would like to do what `compose.py` is doing under the hood yourself, you can run `compose.py` with the `--dry-run` option and then modify the `Dockerfile.compose` file to satisfy your needs. 


### Triton with Unsupported and Custom Backends

You can [create and build your own Triton
backend](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/backend).  The
result of that build should be a directory containing your backend
shared library and any additional files required by the
backend. Assuming your backend is called "mybackend" and that the
directory is "./mybackend", adding the following to the Dockerfile `compose.py`
created will create a Triton image that contains all the supported Triton backends plus your
custom backend.

```
COPY ./mybackend /opt/tritonserver/backends/mybackend
```

You also need to install any additional dependencies required by your
backend as part of the Dockerfile. Then use Docker to create the
image.

```
$ docker build -t tritonserver_custom -f Dockerfile.compose .
```
