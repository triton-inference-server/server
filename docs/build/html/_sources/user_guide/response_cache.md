# Triton Response Cache

## Overview

In this document an *inference request* is the model name, model version, and
input tensors (name, shape, datatype and tensor data) that make up a request
submitted to Triton. An inference result is the output tensors (name, shape,
datatype and tensor data) produced by an inference execution. The response cache
is used by Triton to hold inference results generated for previous executed
inference requests. Triton will maintain the response cache so that inference
requests that hit in the cache will not need to execute a model to produce
results and will instead extract their results from the cache. For some use
cases this can significantly reduce the inference request latency.

Triton accesses the response cache with a hash of the inference request that
includes the model name, model version and model inputs. If the hash is found in
the cache, the corresponding inference result is extracted from the cache and
used for the request. When this happens there is no need for Triton to execute
the model to produce the inference result. If the hash is not found in the
cache, Triton executes the model to produce the inference result, and then
records that result in the cache so that subsequent inference requests can
(re)use those results. 

## Usage

The response cache is enabled by setting a non-zero size (in bytes) when Triton 
is launched using the `--response-cache-byte-size` flag. This flag defaults
to 0 (zero).

> memory management requirements. If you encounter an initialization error

When non-zero, Triton allocates the requested size in CPU memory and **shares the
cache across all inference requests and across all models**. For a given model
to use response caching, the model must enable response caching in the model
configuration. **By default, no model uses response caching even if the response
cache is enabled with the `--response-cache-byte-size` flag.** For more
information on enabling the response cache for each model, see the [model
configuration
docs](model_configuration.md#response-cache).

## Replacement Policy

The response cache is a fixed-size resource, as a result it must be managed by a
replacement policy when the number of cacheable responses exceeds the capacity
of the cache. Currently, the cache only implements a least-recently-used
([LRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)))
replacement policy which will automatically evict one or more LRU entries to
make room for new entries.

## Performance

The response cache is intended to be used for use cases where a significant 
number of duplicate requests (cache hits) are expected and therefore would 
benefit from caching. The term "significant" here is subjective to the use
case, but a simple interpretation would be to consider the proportion of
expected cache hits/misses, as well as the average time spend computing
a response. 

For cases where cache hits are common and computation is expensive, 
the cache can significantly improve overall performance.

For cases where all or most requests are unique (cache misses), the
cache may negatively impact the overall performance due to the overhead
of managing the cache.

## Known Limitations

- Only input tensors located in CPU memory will be hashable for accessing the
  cache. If an inference request contains input tensors not in CPU memory, the
  request will not be hashed and therefore the response will not be cached.
- Only responses with all output tensors located in CPU memory will be eligible
  for caching. If any output tensor in a response is not located in CPU memory,
  the response will not be cached.
- The cache is accessed using only the inference request hash. As a result, if
  two different inference requests generate the same hash (a hash collision),
  then Triton may incorrectly use the cached result for an inference request.
  The hash is a 64-bit value so the likelihood of collision is small.
- Only successful inference requests will have their responses cached. If a
  request fails or returns an error during inference, its response will not be
  cached.
- Only requests going through the Default Scheduler or Dynamic Batch Scheduler
  are eligible for caching. The Sequence Batcher does not currently support
  response caching.
- The response cache does not currently support
  [decoupled models](decoupled_models.md).
