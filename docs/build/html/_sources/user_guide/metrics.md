# Metrics

Triton provides [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics
indicating GPU and request statistics. By default, these metrics are
available at http://localhost:8002/metrics. The metrics are only
available by accessing the endpoint, and are not pushed or published
to any remote server. The metric format is plain text so you can view
them directly, for example:

```
$ curl localhost:8002/metrics
```

The `tritonserver --allow-metrics=false` option can be used to disable
all metric reporting, while the `--allow-gpu-metrics=false` and
`--allow-cpu-metrics=false` can be used to disable just the GPU and CPU
metrics respectively.

The `--metrics-port` option can be used to select a different port. For now,
Triton reuses http address for metrics endpoint. The option `--http-address`
can be used to bind http and metrics endpoints to the same specific address
when http service is enabled.

To change the interval at whichs metrics are polled/updated, see the `--metrics-interval-ms` flag. Metrics that are updated "Per Request" are unaffected by this interval setting. This interval only applies to metrics that are designated as "Per Interval" in the tables of each section below:

- [Inference Request Metrics](#inference-request-metrics)
- [GPU Metrics](#gpu-metrics)
- [CPU Metrics](#cpu-metrics)
- [Response Cache Metrics](#response-cache-metrics)
- [Custom Metrics](#custom-metrics)

## Inference Request Metrics

For models that do not support batching, *Request Count*, *Inference
Count* and *Execution Count* will be equal, indicating that each
inference request is executed separately.

For models that support batching, the count metrics can be interpreted
to determine average batch size as *Inference Count* / *Execution
Count*. The count metrics are illustrated by the following examples:

* Client sends a single batch-1 inference request. *Request Count* =
  1, *Inference Count* = 1, *Execution Count* = 1.

* Client sends a single batch-8 inference request. *Request Count* =
  1, *Inference Count* = 8, *Execution Count* = 1.

* Client sends 2 requests: batch-1 and batch-8. Dynamic batcher is not
  enabled for the model. *Request Count* = 2, *Inference Count* = 9,
  *Execution Count* = 2.

* Client sends 2 requests: batch-1 and batch-1. Dynamic batcher is
  enabled for the model and the 2 requests are dynamically batched by
  the server. *Request Count* = 2, *Inference Count* = 2, *Execution
  Count* = 1.

* Client sends 2 requests: batch-1 and batch-8. Dynamic batcher is
  enabled for the model and the 2 requests are dynamically batched by
  the server. *Request Count* = 2, *Inference Count* = 9, *Execution
  Count* = 1.

## GPU Metrics

GPU metrics are collected through the use of [DCGM](https://developer.nvidia.com/dcgm). 
Collection of GPU metrics can be toggled with the `--allow-gpu-metrics` CLI flag. 
If building Triton locally, the `TRITON_ENABLE_METRICS_GPU` CMake build flag can be used to toggle building the relevant code entirely.

|Category      |Metric          |Metric Name |Description                            |Granularity|Frequency    |
|--------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------|-----------|-------------|
|GPU Utilization |Power Usage   |`nv_gpu_power_usage` |GPU instantaneous power                |Per GPU    |Per interval   |
|              |Power Limit     |`nv_gpu_power_limit` |Maximum GPU power limit                |Per GPU    |Per interval   |
|              |Energy Consumption|`nv_energy_consumption` |GPU energy consumption in joules since Triton started|Per GPU|Per interval|
|              |GPU Utilization |`nv_gpu_utilization` |GPU utilization rate (0.0 - 1.0)       |Per GPU    |Per interval   |

|              |GPU Used Memory |`nv_gpu_memory_used_bytes` |Used GPU memory, in bytes              |Per GPU    |Per interval   |


## CPU Metrics

Collection of CPU metrics can be toggled with the `--allow-cpu-metrics` CLI flag. 
If building Triton locally, the `TRITON_ENABLE_METRICS_CPU` CMake build flag can be used to toggle building the relevant code entirely.

> **Note**
>
> CPU Metrics are currently only supported on Linux.
> They collect information from the [/proc filesystem](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html) such as `/proc/stat` and `/proc/meminfo`.

|Category      |Metric          |Metric Name |Description                            |Granularity|Frequency    |
|--------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------|-----------|-------------|
|CPU Utilization | CPU Utilization | `nv_cpu_utilization` | Total CPU utilization rate [0.0 - 1.0] | Aggregated across all cores since last interval | Per interval |
|CPU Memory      | CPU Total Memory | `nv_cpu_memory_total_bytes` | Total CPU memory (RAM), in bytes | System-wide | Per interval |
|                | CPU Used Memory | `nv_cpu_memory_used_bytes` | Used CPU memory (RAM), in bytes | System-wide | Per interval |

## Response Cache Metrics

Compute latency metrics in the [Inference Request Metrics table](#inference-request-metrics) above are calculated for the
time spent in model inference backends. If the response cache is enabled for a
given model (see [Response Cache](response_cache.md)
docs for more info), total inference times may be affected by response cache
lookup times.

On cache hits, "Cache Hit Lookup Time" indicates the time spent looking up the
response, and "Compute Input Time" /  "Compute Time" / "Compute Output Time"
are not recorded.

On cache misses, "Cache Miss Lookup Time" indicates the time spent looking up
the request hash and "Cache Miss Insertion Time" indicates the time spent
inserting the computed output tensor data into the cache. Otherwise, "Compute
Input Time" /  "Compute Time" / "Compute Output Time" will be recorded as usual.

|Category      |Metric          |Metric Name |Description                            |Granularity|Frequency    |
|--------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------|-----------|-------------|

|Count         |Total Cache Entry Count |`nv_cache_num_entries` |Total number of responses stored in response cache across all models |Server-wide |Per interval |
|              |Total Cache Lookup Count |`nv_cache_num_lookups` |Total number of response cache lookups done by Triton across all models |Server-wide |Per interval |
|              |Total Cache Hit Count |`nv_cache_num_hits` |Total number of response cache hits across all models |Server-wide |Per interval |
|              |Total Cache Miss Count |`nv_cache_num_misses` |Total number of response cache misses across all models |Server-wide |Per interval |
|              |Total Cache Eviction Count |`nv_cache_num_evictions` |Total number of response cache evictions across all models |Server-wide |Per interval |
|              |Cache Hit Count |`nv_cache_num_hits_per_model` |Number of response cache hits per model |Per model |Per request |
|              |Cache Miss Count |`nv_cache_num_misses_per_model` |Number of response cache misses per model |Per model |Per request |
|Latency       |Total Cache Lookup Time |`nv_cache_lookup_duration` |Cumulative time requests spend checking for a cached response across all models (microseconds) |Server-wide |Per interval |
|              |Total Cache Insertion Time |`nv_cache_insertion_duration` |Cumulative time requests spend inserting a response into the cache across all models (microseconds) |Server-wide |Per interval |

|              |Cache Miss Insertion Time |`nv_cache_miss_insertion_duration_per_model` |Cumulative time requests spend inserting responses into the cache on a cache miss (microseconds) |Per model |Per request |

## Custom Metrics

Triton exposes a C API to allow users and backends to register and collect
custom metrics with the existing Triton metrics endpoint. The user takes the
ownership of the custom metrics created through the APIs and must manage their
lifetime following the API documentation.

The 
[identity_backend](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/identity_backend/blob/main/README.md#custom-metric-example)
demonstrates a practical example of adding a custom metric to a backend.

Further documentation can be found in the `TRITONSERVER_MetricFamily*` and
`TRITONSERVER_Metric*` API annotations in
[tritonserver.h](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/core/blob/main/include/triton/core/tritonserver.h).
