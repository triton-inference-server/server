# Testing Triton

Currently there is no CI testing enabled for Triton repositories. We
will enable CI testing in a future update.

However, there is a set of tests in the qa/ directory that can be run
manually to provide extensive testing. Before running these tests you
must first generate a few model repositories containing the models
needed by the tests.

## Generate QA Model Repositories

The QA model repositories contain some simple models that are used to
verify the correctness of Triton. To generate the QA model
repositories:

```
$ cd qa/common
$ ./gen_qa_model_repository
$ ./gen_qa_custom_ops
```

This will create multiple model repositories in /tmp/<version>/qa_*
(for example /tmp/21.09/qa_model_repository).  The TensorRT models
will be created for the GPU on the system that CUDA considers device 0
(zero). If you have multiple GPUs on your system see the documentation
in the scripts for how to target a specific GPU.

## Build QA Image

Next you need to build a QA version of the Triton Docker image. This
image will contain Triton, the QA tests, and all the dependencies
needed to run the QA tests. First do a [Docker image
build](build.md#building-triton-with-docker) to produce the
*tritonserver_build* and *tritonserver* images.

Then build the *tritonserver_sdk* image that contains the client
libraries, model analyzer, and examples using the following
commands. You must first checkout the <client branch> branch of the
*client* repo into the clientrepo/ subdirectory. Typically you want to
set <client branch> to be the same as your current server branch.

```
$ git clone --single-branch --depth=1 -b <client branch> https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client.git clientrepo
$ docker build -t tritonserver_sdk -f Dockerfile.sdk .
```

Lastly, build the actual QA image.

```
$ docker build -t tritonserver_qa -f Dockerfile.QA .
```

## Run QA Container

Now run the QA container and mount the QA model repositories into the
container so the tests will be able to access them.

```
$ docker run --gpus=all -it --rm -v/tmp:/data/inferenceserver tritonserver_qa
```

Within the container the QA tests are in /opt/tritonserver/qa. To run
a test simply change directory to the test and run the test.sh script.

```
$ cd <test directory>
$ bash -x ./test.sh
```
