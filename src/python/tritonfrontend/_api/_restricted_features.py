    Using `RestrictedFeatures` users can restrict access to certain features provided by
    the `KServeHttp` and `KServeGrpc` frontends. In order to use a restricted feature,
    the key-value pair ({`key`:`value`}) needs to be as a header with the request to the endpoint.
    Note: For the `KServeGrpc` endpoint, the header key needs a prefix of `triton-grpc-protocol-`
    when sending a request.

    Internally, the `RestrictedFeatures` class:
    - Stores collections of FeatureGroup instances
    - Maintains FeatureGroup's down into one Feature
    - Checks for collisions for `Feature` instances among groups.
    - Serialize the data into a JSON string.
